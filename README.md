# Research Paper Recommendation System

### Introduction:
A hyrbid recommendation system is created for users who search for research papers. Content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques are implemented for identifying articles to recommend. TF-IDF scores are utilized to find similar items in content-based filtering. Weighted ranking is performed on the filtered articles based on influential factors. Citation analysis algorithm is utilized to find similar articles in collaborative filtering.

### Dataset:
Dataset is crawled from Semantic Scholar website for articles in five domains.

### Models/Approaches:
A hybrid model with the following approaches is created.
1. Content-based filtering
2. Collaborative filtering


### Evaluation:
1. Discounted Cummulative Gain
2. User Satisfaction Survey
